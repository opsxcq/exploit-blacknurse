/**
 * Black Nurse Exploit
 *
 * by opsxcq (github.com/opsxcq)
 * this flaw was discovered by Kenneth B. Jørgensen and Lenny Hansson.
 *
 * Blacknurse is a low bandwidth ICMP attack that is capable of doing denial of service to well known 
 * firewalls. Most ICMP attacks that we see are based on ICMP Type 8 Code 0 also called a ping flood 
 * attack. BlackNurse is based on ICMP with Type 3 Code 3 packets. We know that when a user has allowed 
 * ICMP Type 3 Code 3 to outside interfaces, the BlackNurse attack becomes highly effective even at low 
 * bandwidth. Low bandwidth is in this case around 15-18 Mbit/s. This is to achieve the volume of packets 
 * needed which is around 40 to 50K packets per second. It does not matter if you have a 1 Gbit/s Internet 
 * connection. The impact we see on different firewalls is typically high CPU loads. When an attack is 
 * ongoing, users from the LAN side will no longer be able to send/receive traffic to/from the Internet. 
 * All firewalls we have seen recover when the attack stops.
